# Challenge #9 - Week 9:

# Project Description
### What is this project?
For this weeks project I am tasked to develop a functioning README Generator, to be used by any developer who wants to create a professional README file for their github repositories. 

By using Node.js, I have developed a functional README generator that displays a series of questions for the user to answer inside their console/terminal. Afterwhich the generator will write the users input to a new file title "README-2.md". Presenting a professional README file for the user. 

### Files modified
For this project I have heavily relied modified the following files. index.js and generateMarkdown.js

### Challenges


# Installation
To install this application for your own device. You will require node. Additionally packages such as inquirer are essential for this application to function properly. Inquirer enables
the prompt to be displayed and allow user input from their terminal/console. 

Furthermore, running node index.js will display a welcome message and prompts from the command line for user input. Afterwards a README-2.md file will be created and ready to be used for the user!
